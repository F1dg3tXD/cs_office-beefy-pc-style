## 🛠️ What the Script Does

The script offers a menu-driven setup to configure the following:

| Option | Description                                                     |

| 3      | Sets a custom retro wallpaper                                   |
| 4      | Enables classic screensavers (via `xscreensaver`)               |

| 6      | Adds support for **Windows XP/2000 sound effects**              |
| 7      | Runs **all of the above**                                       |

## 🔊 Adding Windows 2000/XP Sound Effects

To enable startup/shutdown/login sounds:

1. Place your `.wav` sound files into:

   ```
   ~/.config/cs_office_pc/sounds/
   ```

2. The script will generate a file:

   ```
   ~/.config/cs_office_pc/sounds/expected_sounds.txt
   ```

   This lists all expected filenames like:

   * `Windows XP Startup.wav`
   * `Windows XP Shutdown.wav`
   * `Windows XP Error.wav`
   * `Windows XP Notify.wav`

3. Rerun the script and select option `6` to configure the sounds.

📝 **Note:** Only the startup sound is hooked automatically (via `autostart`). You can use the remaining sounds manually or with custom system event scripts.
